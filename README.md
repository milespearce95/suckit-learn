# suckit-learn

A fun experiment where Iâ€™m building my own version of Pandas and Scikit-learn in C++! The goal: data manipulation and machine learning.
Features:

    DataFrames & Series for handling data
    Basic ML models (regression, classification, etc.)
    Basic data wranglingwith none of the performance!

This has been done without looking up how to actually do it / how it is actually handled in the pandas / scikit source code as I don't want to just translate / steal it, that feels redundant, this was just me bored over the Christmas holidays having a bit of fun.
